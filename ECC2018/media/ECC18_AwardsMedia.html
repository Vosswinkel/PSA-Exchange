The “European Control Award" (ECA) is to recognize outstanding contributions by a young researcher in the area of systems and control. The award is sponsored by the European Control Association (EUCA), and is presented during the annual European Control Conference. The recipient must have spent a major part of his or her career in Europe and, at the time of the nomination, must be working in a research institution or company in Europe. The ECA award committee (independent of EUCA members) selects the candidate, which is then approved by the EUCA Council.
