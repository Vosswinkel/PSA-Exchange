In 1990, members of the Systems and Control community from across the European Union decided to set up an organization, named the European Union Control Association (EUCA), with the main goal of promoting initiatives that enhance scientific exchange, disseminate information, and coordinate research networks and technology transfer in the field of Systems and Control within the Union.
</p><p align="justify">
EUCA launched its first major initiative in 1991 with a series of wide-spectrum conferences called the European Control Conferences (ECC). The goal of these conferences was to promote the science and technology of control in the broadest sense – whether in engineering, physical, biological, social or economic, and in both theory and application. The first ECC was held in Grenoble in 1991, under the chairmanship of Professor Ioan Landau, and was attended by about 650 people. The ECC was subsequently held every two years until 2011. Since 2013 it has been held annually.
</p><p align="justify">EUCA’s second major initiative came in 1995 with the launch of the European Journal of Control, a scientific journal that would 
serve as EUCA’s main channel for disseminating important contributions to the field of Systems and Control. The first issue of the journal appeared in September of that year under the editorial direction of Professor Landau. For a decade starting in 2003, Professor Sergio Bittanti was the editor-in-chief. In July 2013, he was succeeded by Professor Alessandro Astolfi, and then by Professor Thomas Parisini is 2018.
</p><p align="justify">
In 2012 the association was re-formed as the European Control Association (EUCA) to reflect the growing scope of the organization. 
</p><p align="justify">
The European Control Conference (ECC) aims to bring together academic and industrial professionals in the field of systems and control, and to promote scientific cooperation and exchanges within Europe and between Europe and other parts of the World.
</p><p align="justify">
ECC18 is the 16th in the EUCA Series of European Control Conferences and will be held in Limassol, Cyprus from June 12 to June 15, 2018. The 2018 local organizer is the KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence, which operates within the University of Cyprus. Prof. Marios Polycarpou serves as General Chair, and Prof. Thomas Parisini as Program Chair.
</p><p align="justify">
Technical co-sponsorship of the event is provided by the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS), and the event is held in cooperation with the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC).
