<b>Abstract:</b>
"Paracontractions" are nonlinear maps which arise in certain optimization and estimation problems and in various types of numerical calculations. In this talk a distributed algorithm is described for finding a common fixed point of a family of paracontraction assuming that such a common fixed point exists. The common fixed point is simultaneously computed by agents assuming each agent knows only the current estimates of the fixed point generated by its neighbors, and nothing more. Each agent recursively updates its estimate of the fixed point by utilizing the current estimates generated by each of its neighbors. Neighbor relations are characterized by a time-dependent directed graph whose vertices correspond to agents and whose arcs depict neighbor relations. For any family of paracontractions whose members have at least one common fixed point, and any sequence of strongly connected neighbor graphs, the algorithm causes all agent estimates to converge to a common fixed point. Generalizations of this result are also discussed. Finally, as an application of these results, a provably correct and resilient distributed algorithm is described for estimating the state of an autonomous linear system of the form.

<b>Abstract:</b>
One of the main assumptions of classical machine learning is that data are generated by a stationary concept. This, however, is violated in practical applications e.g. in the context of lifelong learning, for the task of system personalization, or whenever sensor degradation or non-stationary environments cause a fundamental change of the observed signals. Within the talk, we will give an overview about recent developments in the field of learning with concept drift, and we will address two particular challenges in more detail: (1) How to cope with a fundamental change of the data representation which is caused e.g. by a misplacement or exchange of sensors? (2) How to deal with heterogeneous concept drift, i.e. mixed rapid or smooth, virtual or real drift, e.g. caused by a real-life non-stationary environment? We will present novel intuitive distance-based classification approaches which can tackle such settings by means of suitable metric learning and brain-inspired adaptive memory concepts, respectively, and we will demonstrate their performance in different application domains ranging from computer vision to the control of protheses.

<b>Abstract:</b>
This talk will present a novel approach for the analysis and design of systems that switch and oscillate. While such nonlinear behaviors abound in control engineering of electrical, mechanical, and biological circuits, it is often considered that they largely fall outside the scope of control theory. In contrast, the proposed approach closely mimics linear-quadratic dissipativity theory, a very foundation of modern control theory. In its classical formulation, dissipativity theory formulates system properties as dissipation inequalities to be satisfied by the storage, an abstraction of the system internal energy. Linear systems admit quadratic storages. When the storage is positive definite, it serves as a Lyapunov function for stability analysis of equilibria. Our generalization rests on two distinct ingredients. First, we apply dissipativity theory differentially: instead of studying the nonlinear system via the nonlinear theory, we apply the linear theory to a family of linearized systems. Second, we relax the positivity constraint of the quadratic storage to a fixed inertia constraint. We allow for one negative eigenvalue in the analysis of switches and two negative eigenvalues in the analysis of clocks. The talk will illustrate the theory in classical models of switches and clocks and discuss the potential of dissipativity theory for the analysis and design of interconnected systems away from equilibrium.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Modern approaches to the design of robots are changing the way robots are built, often inspired by a philosophy of embodied intelligence, by which many natural behaviors are deeply rooted in the way our bodies are built. Accordingly, the physical structure of robots is evolving from traditional rigid, heavy industrial machines into soft bodies exhibiting new levels of versatility, adaptability, safety, elasticity, dynamism and energy efficiency. New challenges and opportunities arise for the control of soft robots: for instance, carefully planning for collision avoidance may no longer be a dominating concern, being on the contrary physical interaction with the environment not only allowed, but even desirable to solve complex tasks. Similarly, the traditional use of high-authority feedback loops to control robot motion is challenged by the desire to maintain adaptability to the environment. In this talk I will discuss how these challenges can be addressed, at least partially, by looking at how humans use their own bodies in similar tasks.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Self- Driving cars are attracting a lot of attention and excitement as they will impact driving comfort and safety as well as modify the current modes of transporting people and goods. Getting rid of the driver however will not necessarily reduce congestion whose main cause is the high volume of vehicles competing in space and time to reach destinations. Connectivity however and compliance to traffic management commands and traffic rules by vehicle autopilots will open the way for far better traffic flow control approaches with strong potential to improve capacity, manage congestion and incidents in a much more effective way. In this talk we present some of the main challenges self-driving vehicles will be facing and how connectivity with the infrastructure is far more crucial than vehicle automation when it comes to traffic flow control. We will present several designs of traffic flow control and load balancing which can bring significant benefits to traffic flow characteristics and efficiency with positive impact on the environment.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Symbolic control aims at designing “correct by construction” controllers for continuous dynamical systems, by using algorithmic discrete synthesis techniques. The key concept in symbolic control is that of symbolic model, which is a finite-state dynamical system, obtained by abstracting continuous trajectories over a finite set of symbols. When the symbolic and the continuous dynamics are formally related by some behavioral relationship (e.g. simulation or bisimulation relations), controllers synthesized for the symbolic model using discrete synthesis techniques can be refined to certified controllers for the original continuous system. In the first part of this talk, I will present some fundamental results on symbolic control from symbolic model computation, to discrete synthesis and controller refinement. Then, I will report some recent progress on scalability and robustness by means of compositional and quantitative synthesis techniques.
