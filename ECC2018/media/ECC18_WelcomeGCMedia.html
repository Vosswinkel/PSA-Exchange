On behalf of the ECC2018 Organizing Committee and the European Control Association (EUCA), it is my great pleasure to welcome you to Cyprus, Limassol, and to the 16th European Control Conference. 
</p><p align="justify">
This is the first time that the ECC is held in Cyprus and it will be hosted by the beautiful seaside city of Limassol. ECC18 is organized by the University of Cyprus and the KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence. We hope that you will enjoy the outstanding technical program, as well as the cultural atmosphere, the spectacular beaches and the delicious Mediterranean cuisine. The conference organizers and the student volunteers will do their best to make this conference a memorable event for all the participants. So, if you need anything, do not be shy to ask.    
</p><p align="justify">
Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It became an independent country in 1960 and joined the European Union 
as a full member in 2004. Cyprus is famous for its archeological sites, the beautiful churches and monasteries that are designated by UNESCO as World Heritage sites, the gorgeous beaches and the hospitality of its people. I hope you will have the opportunity to witness first-hand all these and more. 
</p><p align="justify">
For ECC18, there are 525 accepted papers that are organized in 10 parallel sessions over three days. I am sure that you will find many interesting and exciting presentations to choose from. There are two plenary lectures every day, delivered by Stephen Morse (Yale University), Barbara Hammer (Bielefeld University), Rodolphe Sepulchre (University of Cambridge), Antonio Bicchi (University of Pisa), Petros Ioannou (University of Southern California) and the 2018 European Control Award winner Antoine Girard (CNRS). In addition, there are six stimulating pre-conference workshops that will be held on Tuesday, 12 June, the day before the beginning of the technical program. 
</p><p align="justify">
The organization of a conference of this size requires the coordinated effort of many volunteers. I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work with close friends, which made the effort worthwhile and enjoyable. First, I would like to thank Thomas Parisini, who served both as the Program Chair, as well as the Chair of the Conference Editorial Board, and ensured with his experience and dedication a smooth review process and helped to put together an outstanding technical program. With Thomas, I have a longtime close friendship and collaboration, which I value greatly. My sincere thanks to my colleagues at the University of Cyprus, Christos Panayiotou and Christoforos Hadjicostis, who served as General Co-Chairs and did a fantastic job in handling all the difficult tasks, such as finances, registration, as well as any unexpected events that arose. I would also like to thank John Lygeros for the impressive list of pre-conference Workshops offered at ECC18 and the Publications Chairs Laura Menini and Andrea Serrani for the superb handling of all publication issues. Special thanks to Alessandro Astolfi for chairing the evaluation process for the Best Student Paper Award. 
</p><p align="justify">
The success of the conference depends largely on an outstanding local organizing team, which has done a really wonderful job and have dedicated countless hours, day and night, to ensure that the conference runs smoothly. Especially, I would like to thank the conference secretariat Despina Petrou and the local arrangements chair Stelios Timotheou, as well as the rest of the local organizing committee: Christos Laoudias, Demetrios Eliades, Mihalis Tsiakkas, Panayiotis Kolios and Savvas Papaioannou. I would also like to thank Christina Distra and Marianna Charalambous from Top Kinisis for the superb management of the logistical details of the conference, and the many students and volunteers from the KIOS Center of Excellence at the University of Cyprus for their enthusiastic support during the whole duration of the event. 
</p><p align="justify">
I wish all the participants a successful, productive and stimulating conference!
