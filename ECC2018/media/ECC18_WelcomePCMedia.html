The 16th European Control Conference (ECC) is the 2018 flagship technical event sponsored by the European Control Association (EUCA) and continues the tradition of this highly successful conference series. In chairing the Program Committee, I have had an outstanding support from the members of the Senior International Program Committee, namely Alessandro Astolfi (Imperial College London), Franco Blanchini (Università di Udine), Christophe Prieur (CNRS), Daniel Rivera (Arizona State University), and Nathan Van De Wouw (Eindhoven University of Technology). We really worked as a team of friends in all aspects of the program preparation.

One of the key attributes of the ECC is the rigorous peer review process for all contributed and invited papers. It is worth mentioning that contributed and invited papers undergo the same review process. An invaluable contribution to the quality of the program has been given by the EUCA Conference Editorial Board (EUCA CEB). This is a standing Committee formed by 94 members, covering all research areas. Without the hard and timely work by these dedicated volunteers, no ECC Program would exist. Following the more recent tradition since ECC 2013, a two-stage review process has been established with the aim of improving the quality of reviews and decisions. After the usual first round of reviews and recommendations handled by the EUCA CEB, all submissions have been re-arranged in areas according to the topic and, for each area, a member of the Senior Program Committee revised all the recommendations made on the first stage, adding more reviews when needed, and possibly revising the recommendation obtained at the first stage. Overall, thanks to the tireless efforts by the EUCA CEB and the Senior Program Committee, a total of 2319 reviews were obtained for 829 submissions, representing an average of 2.8 reviews per paper. Of these, 525 contributed and invited papers were accepted for presentation at the conference yielding an acceptance rate of about 63%.

For the first time, the conference features two plenary lectures per day, delivered by prominent colleagues in our field. These lectures include the one on Friday morning by the EUCA Award winner. The General Chair and I are very grateful to our plenary lecturers for accepting our invitation and for their outstanding contribution to the quality and scientific attractiveness of the technical program.

I am deeply indebted to all who have helped in organising the conference, to whom I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation. I enjoyed immensely undertaking this endeavor, as it gave me another opportunity to work with Marios, one of my best friends and colleagues. As it happened already several times, I learnt a lot from him. A big thank you is deserved to all the KIOS friends; allow me to especially thank Despina Petrou and Stelios Timotheou for their huge help in addressing many daily issues, always with a smile and with great patience for my lateness in getting back to them.
