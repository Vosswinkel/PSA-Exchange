Workshop 1: Simple Adaptive Control and New Results in Stability Analysis

<b>Description:</b>
Simple Adaptive Control (SAC) techniques have been conceived for large-scale systems. While initially considered to be just a modest version of the standard Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), it was only before appropriate mathematical tools of analysis had been developed. Further developments showed that they can easily be applied to such applications as robots, planes, missiles, satellites, fine motion control, etc. Drawbacks related to classical MRAC have been addressed and eliminated and conditions needed for robust stability have been mitigated. Recent developments in nonlinear systems stability analysis tools lead to clear proofs of SAC stability in realistic environments. Realistic examples are used to show that indeed SAC is the Stable Direct MRAC methodology. A non-minimum-phase and unstable UAV will be used as a detailed case-study. Application to real hardware will be demonstrated.
</p><p align="justify">
The basic Lyapunov stability theory requires fitting a Positive Definite function to the system whose derivative is Negative Definite. Because early extensions of Lyapunov stability theory were only covering autonomous systems, various alternatives were sought for non-autonomous systems. Yet they impose conditions of uniform continuity that again could limit its applicability. Besides, even when applicable, it only ends with partial results. Although extensions of LaSalle’s Invariance Principle to non-autonomous systems have been available at least since 1976, they have remained surprisingly unknown for the nonlinear control community. Moreover, even if assumedly known, misinterpretations of its larger mathematical scope (that covers much more than mere asymptotic stability) may have misled the users with respect to its usefulness. The review of LaSalle’s Invariance Principle together with presentation of various alternatives to stability analysis may help showing the extreme efficiency of the new Theorems of Stability to nonlinear systems stability analysis.

<b>Description:</b>
The workshop provides a forum for a comprehensive exposition and discussion on how paradigmatic analysis and synthesis problems formulated for complex dynamical systems can be effectively investigated and solved through methodological approaches primarily grounded on structural views.
</p><p align="justify">
Complex dynamical systems emerge in a variety of disciplines and domains, ranging from those that deal with physical processes (biology, genetics, environmental sciences, etc.) to those that concern man-made systems (engineering, energy, finance, etc.). Indeed, in these fields, it is more and more common to refer to dynamical structures such as systems of systems, hybrid systems and multimodal systems. In brief, the former ones consist of many interconnected dynamical systems with various topological patterns and hierarchical relations; the second ones are dynamical systems that exhibit dynamics of a different nature, both continuous and discrete; the third ones are dynamical systems whose behavior may vary during their lifecycle owing to different operating conditions or depending on the occurrence of some events. The dynamical structures with these characteristics are currently modelled as, e.g., multi-agent systems, hybrid impulsive systems, switching systems, implicit switching systems, and so forth.
</p><p align="justify">
Consequently, control design techniques have changed to adapt to the ever-increasing system complexity. In this scenario, 
structural methodologies — i.e., those methods which have evolved from original graph theories, differential-algebraic techniques and geometric approaches to linear and nonlinear control—have proven to be particularly powerful for several reasons. Beforehand, the structural approaches privilege the essential features of dynamical systems and their interconnections, thus yielding abstractions that can fit a wide variety of situations. Meanwhile, the geometric perspective, which is often at the basis of the structural approaches, introduces a relevant visual and intuitive component which fosters research advancements. Nevertheless, the formalization of the structural and geometric concepts is rendered with algebraic tools, which, in turn, have a direct correspondence with computational algorithms, thus paving the way to actual implementation in engineering applications.
</p><p align="justify">
The workshop is organized in such a way that the discussion starts from a general description of complexity and structural attitudes towards it, then it focuses on some fundamental problems and, finally, it dwells on applications. In more detail, an overview on the complex systems emerging in the various fields, on the new challenges of engineering design and on how these can be mastered by means of the structural approaches is provided first. A novel geometric view, based on transformations which maintain the invariance of global properties, such as stability or H-infinity norm, is described and shown to provide new tools to investigate stability and to parametrize the set of the stabilizing controllers. A graph-theoretic-based approach is then shown to be an effective tool to analyze controllability in leader/follower multi-agent systems and to understand the effects of the underlying network structure. How solvability of the output regulation problem in hybrid linear systems with periodic state jumps can be investigated by structural methods is then illustrated. A mixed digraph-theory and geometric approach is exploited to solve another classic problem of system and control theory, i.e. disturbance decoupling, for a special class of hybrid switching systems. Furthermore, the synthesis of unknown-input state observers with minimum-complexity is tackled by structural tools in the context of linear impulsive systems: necessary and sufficient solvability conditions are derived once a set of essential requirements has been disentangled. The disturbance decoupling problem is also investigated for a class of implicit switching systems through geometric considerations inspired to the behavioral approach. In particular, the theoretical results are applied to the synthesis of a Beard-Jones filter. Finally, another meaningful application is considered in depth: a structural perspective is adopted to analyze Huygens synchronization over distributed media and it reveals a complex, but structured behavior, behind a seemingly chaotic one.

<b>Description:</b>
Safe, reliable and efficient operation of large-scale industrial processes has always been a driver for the development of innovative approaches in the field of control theory. Process control, which in the 70’s paved the way to the advent of model predictive control, nowadays embraces methods from optimization, system identification and control theory. The combination of these tools is expected to be even more central in future production processes, which will be characterized by ubiquitous sensing and actuation, distributed computation, and massive communication between devices. While technological frameworks such as the Internet of Things, the Industrial Internet and Industry 4.0 have started emerging, methodological foundations for the reliable operation of cyberphysical industrial systems are still lagging behind. The goal of this workshop is to gather experts in the area of optimization of industrial processes to present state-of-art methods as well perspectives for the future.
</p><p align="justify">
Moreover, the workshop will give the opportunity to honour and celebrate the achievements of one of the key players in the area: Prof. Dominique Bonvin who turned 65 and retired from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL, Switzerland) in 2017.
