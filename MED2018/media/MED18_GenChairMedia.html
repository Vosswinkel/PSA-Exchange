Dear Colleagues, on behalf of the Organizing Committee of the 26th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation we would like to welcome you in Zadar, one of the oldest coastal cities in Croatia!
</p><p align="justify">
This is the second time that MED conference takes place in Croatia. This called for exceptional motivation and responsibility of the Organizing Committee as we wanted to make MED 2018 even better than MED 2001 and to keep high standards of MED conferences series. That is why all committee members put a lot of effort in organizational activities of this year’s conference. As General Co-Chairs we would like to thank them all for their hard work. We also would like to thank the technical program committee members who have done great work on selection of the papers to be presented at the conference.
</p><p align="justify">
Our main goal was to provide an opportunity for the academic, research and industrial community to exchange ideas and experiences regarding future research directions. That is why a broad range of topics is covered by accepted articles, following current trends of combining control/systems theory with software/communication technologies, as well as new developments in robotics and mechatronics, autonomous systems, unmanned systems, cyber physical systems, network controlled systems. We hope this will also help strengthen cooperation of control and automation scientists with industry.
</p><p align="justify">
This year’s MED conference paid special attention to students’ activities, which was the motivation behind Industrial challenges, a novelty in MED conference series. Industrial challenges were organized in three domains: i) aerial robotics and perception, ii) automotive control, and iii) process automation, and supported by leading industrial partners – Siemens, MathWorks, dSPACE and Rimac Automobili. Industrial challenges provided students with an opportunity to work on the state of the art equipment and to gain experience in implementation of theoretical results in real systems.
At the end we wish you joyful and memorable conference and a pleasant stay in Zadar and Croatia.
