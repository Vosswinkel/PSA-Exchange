As a group of young scientists and engineers at early stage of our careers we share knowledge, enthusiasm and collaboration readiness around the globe. Multidisciplinarity and diversity in perspectives are our tools for pushing new technologies. We are IEEE Young Professionals and we will see you there at MED 2018. On Wednesday, June 20, you will have a chance to meet us at our networking event “Young Professionals Meet Up” within a casual atmosphere of a nearby bar.
