<b>Partnership:</b>	Organized by the 3Smart project and supported by Siemens and MathWorks<br>
<b>Application:</b>	Cooling of a three-room building
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Summary:</b>
The challenge focuses on the process of cooling a building that consists of three rooms with fan coils units. The building is connected to a smart electricity grid. The goal is to design a controller for fan coils fans on-off state and the chiller setpoint temperature that will make the building smart, and to make it work on a programmable logic controller (PLC). Tools used for controller design and simulation are Matlab/Simulink from MathWorks and TIA portal from Siemens.

<b>Finals at MED 2018:</b>
For the finalist teams, there are the following elements of evaluation: 
<ol>
<li>there is a small change of the assignment and the teams are asked to perform the necessary adaptations of the controller, which will be evaluated in MATLAB environment, 
<li>the selected 1-hour window of the test-scenario is evaluated via a real PLC connected via MATLAB OPC toolbox to the Simulink scheme where the building process is simulated in real time and the performance will be evaluated according to the same criterion ??. Weights for the evaluation elements in the finals are 0.25 and 0.25, respectively. 
</ol>
The challenge winner team will be announced at the conference gala dinner and each of the two representatives of the winning team will be awarded with an Industrial IOT device Simatic IOT 2040.

<b>Partnership:</b>	Organized by Rimac Automobili and supported by dSPACE and MathWorks<br>
<b>Application:</b>	Automated drift control of an automobile
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Summary:</b>
The goal of this challenge is to drive a given vehicle down a short, curved road segment, in such a way that the vehicle “drifts” as impressively as possible. To achieve this, contestants needed to design a control algorithm that intentionally drives the vehicle into an unstable equilibrium state and maintains this state through careful application of control inputs.
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Finals at MED 2018:</b>
Stage B (the finals) consists of implementing the control algorithm in a format suitable for execution on the dSPACE MicroAutoBox II Rapid Development Platform (RDP). The Stage B teams are provided with a software package that will allow them to adapt their control algorithm in Simulink and generate code for the RDP. In addition, teams will receive a specification for the CAN communication between the RDP and the vehicle, which the control algorithm will need to adhere to.

<b>Application:</b>	Wind Farm inspection
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Summary:</b>
In the first stage, teams competed in three tasks, all performed in a simulation environment, using Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulator: hovering under wind conditions for 2 minutes, localizing the plane of rotation of a wind generator, detecting up to 5 blade defects.
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Finals at MED 2018:</b>
First three teams have been promoted to the second stage and have won a chance to apply their algorithms on real platforms and compete during the conference. The second stage will be held at the conference venue, using Parrot Bebop platform in a mockup wind farm environment.
