<b>Abstract:</b>
Finding some or all of the roots of a set of multivariate polynomials has numerous applications. This century old problem is at the foundation of algebraic geometry sometimes called the ‘queen of mathematics’. In this discipline, typically, numerical computations are done symbolically, and only quite recently, it was realized that the multivariate polynomial rooting problem can be tackled using the machinery of numerical linear algebra, because of the fundamental insight that it is equivalent to an eigenvalue problem. In order to find some or all roots, we deploy tools like the QR- and singular value decomposition, and (possibly large scale) iterative eigenvalue solvers.  We will discuss several eigenvalue decomposition based algorithms to calculate the global minimum of multivariate polynomial optimization problems.  We will illustrate our approach with the numerical solution of two open problems in system theory: Calculating from (noisy) data linear dynamic models that are least squares optimal, and finding the least squares global optimum of the H2 model reduction problem.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Recent years have seen a great progress in the area of robotics.  Communication signals are also ubiquitous these days.  In this talk, I will explore the opportunities and challenges at this intersection, for robotic sensing and communication.  For instance, imagine two unmanned vehicles arriving behind thick concrete walls. They have no prior knowledge of the area behind these walls, but are interested in imaging every square inch of the invisible area through the walls with a high accuracy. Can the robots achieve this with only WiFi signals?  In the first part of the talk, I will show that this is indeed possible. I will discuss how our methodology for the co-optimization of path planning and communication has enabled the first demonstration of 3d imaging through walls with only drones and WiFi. I will also discuss other new sensing capabilities that have emerged from our approach, such as occupancy estimation and crowd analytics with only WiFi signals.
</p><p align="justify">
In the second part of the talk, I will focus on communication-aware robotics, a term coined to refer to robotic systems that explicitly take communication issues into account in their decision making, in order to enable robust connectivity and networked task accomplishment. This is an emerging area of research that not only allows a team of unmanned vehicles to achieve the desired connectivity during their operation, but can also extend the connectivity of the existing communication systems through the use of mobility. I will then discuss our latest theoretical and experimental results along this line. I will show how each robot can go beyond the over-simplified but commonly-used disk model for connectivity, and realistically model the impact of channel uncertainty for the purpose of path planning.  I will then show how the unmanned vehicles can properly co-optimize their communication, sensing and navigation objectives under resource constraints. This co-optimized approach can result in a significant performance improvement, as we shall see in the talk.  I will also discuss the role of human collaboration in these networks.

<b>Abstract:</b>
We began using robots to help us with simple and repetitive tasks. Now, we are introducing automation in ever increasing safety critical and complex tasks:  intelligent transportation networks, smart power grid, robotics search and rescue, personalized medicine. How do we ensure that these autonomous systems contribute to making our societies safer and more efficient? To answer this question, we have to address two main control challenges: 1) The autonomous systems need to complete complex tasks in partially known changing environments; 2) Network of interacting autonomous systems need to coordinate their decision making and optimise their choices using only local information. Guided by addressing these two challenges, I will present the two main threads of my research. Specifically, I discuss my latest works on data-driven safe control synthesis in uncertain environments and on game theory and mechanism design for coordinating multi-agent decision making. In both cases, I present the underlying theoretical tools and discuss potential applications.
