On behalf of the Mediterranean Control Association, WELCOME to MED ’18, the 26th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation!  Welcome to Zadar, Croatia!
</p><p align="justify">
The Mediterranean Control Association (MCA) is the sponsoring, parent organization, which selects the organizers and venues, and oversees all the MED conferences. MCA was founded in 1998 and is registered in Cyprus as a non-profit organization (see the MCA website at www.med-control.org).
</p><p align="justify">
The very first MED took place in 1993 in Chania, Greece and over the next quarter century the MED has been in Cyprus, Malta, Italy, France, Croatia, Turkey, Israel, Portugal, Morocco, Spain and several times in Greece (for a complete list of the MED conferences, see www.med-control.org). This year we are meeting for the second time in Croatia.  Dubrovnik, Croatia was the venue for the 9th MED Conference, MED ’01.
</p><p align="justify">
The MED conferences have always been about bringing together researchers in the area of Control Systems and Automation from the Mediterranean countries, who share much more than technical interests, among other things, culture and history. Since the beginning, the MED conferences have been technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Control Systems Society and the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and they have consistently kept high quality standards both in the technical program and the conference organization. This is primarily due to the authors, who submit technically sound papers, and also to the tremendous effort of all the volunteers involved in the technical evaluation of these papers and in the organization of the conferences. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them all for their time, effort and wonderful work. Thank you! 
</p><p align="justify">
As a reminder, the MED Conference Proceedings may be found on line in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library at http://ieeexplore.ieee.org. The Proceedings of early MED Conferences may be downloaded from www.med-control.org.
</p><p align="justify">
Looking ahead, the next MED, MED ’19, goes to Akko (Acre), Israel (July 1-4, 2019) and I am looking forwards to seeing you all there, as well!
</p><p align="justify">
I hope you do experience and enjoy what MED ’18 has to offer, and you also take full advantage of your stay in Zadar, enjoying the sites.
</p><p align="justify">
Thank you for your participation and contributions to MED ’18!
</p>
<b>Panos Antsaklis, President<br>
Mediterranean Control Association (MCA)</b>
